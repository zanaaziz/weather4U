# Weather4U
Weather4U is a simple web app built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.<br>
As the name might suggest, it displays real time weather forecast information thanks to the great guys over at Yahoo! Weather.

You can search any location around the world which the app will respond with the forecast of that location for the next seven days.

Also, you can save locations which you might check frequently and those favourited locations will be stored on the MongoDB database which will then be found neatly in the 'Favourites' page.
