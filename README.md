## How To Use GitHub On Cloud9
We have to use Git to pull and push to our project repo on GitHub. Basically, everytime you open cloud9 to do work, you must do these steps:
1. Before you code anything new, you must pull from GitHub so that you're not working on old code. To do this, you will find a terminal at the bottom of the editor called 'bash - "your-cloud9-username"'. This terminal is what you use to run any commands such as in this case Git.
2. In the terminal, run 'git pull'.
