# Weather4U
Weather4U is a simple web app built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.<br>
As the name might suggest, it displays real time forecast information thanks to the great guys over at Yahoo! Weather for providing their API.

You can search any location and the app will respond with the forecast of the next seven days.

You can also save locations that you might check frequently and they will be stored neatly for you in the 'Favourites' page.

## Update Saved Location
Selecting the edit button will bring you to a page where you can enter the new location for which you'd like to set.<br>
It will then update and apply the changes accordingly.

## Delete Saved Location
Deleting a saved location will of course delete it, update, and apply the changes to your favourites.<br>
If you have no saved locations, you will just see a very sad page...
